    <p>My journey began with personal struggle. Addiction had led me to experience homelessness multiple times, and during those harsh winters, I witnessed the devastating reality of survival on the streets. I personally knew seven people who tragically froze to death.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
      "While I was homeless, I remember feeling the chill all the way to my bones. I couldn't even think or function. It completely zapped me of my energy so much that I was losing my will to live."
    </div>
    
    <p>Despite having a car, a storage unit, and sufficient income, homelessness crushed my spirit. I began to wonder: if this experience was so overwhelming for me, how much harder would it be for someone with even fewer resources?</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>My turning point came when I learned about foam clothing. In that moment, I felt a profound calling - this was how I could help. Through prayer and perseverance, I connected with Marian Edmonds-Allen from the Utah Pride Center, who shared my passion for supporting vulnerable populations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>After a period of personal recovery and stability, I met Angela Roth in January 2017. Angela was a talented seamstress who had been praying for an opportunity to make a meaningful difference. Together, we founded the Turtle Shelter Project.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Our mission was simple but powerful: create affordable, life-saving vests for people experiencing homelessness. We designed a vest that could keep a person's core warm, using innovative foam insulation technology. By leveraging volunteer labor, we kept production costs low - just $30 per vest.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Between September 2017 and January 2018, we produced 50 "Turtle Shelter" vests. We field-tested them with people experiencing homelessness and continuously improved the design, adding features like hoods, pockets, and sturdy belts.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
      "We want these vests to go to people living outdoors or who don't have access to shelters, because they are the ones who need this technology the most."
    </div>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>The vests are called "Turtle Shelters" because they provide portable protection - just like a turtle carrying its home. By harnessing and conserving body heat, these vests can be a literal lifeline during brutal winter conditions.</p>
